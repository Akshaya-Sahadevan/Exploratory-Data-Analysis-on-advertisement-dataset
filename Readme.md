# Unveiling Product Price Insights Through Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Modeling

**Harnessing the Power of Data Analysis with Python**
Data analysis is an essential tool for uncovering valuable insights hidden within data sets. Python's rich ecosystem of libraries provides powerful methods for visualization, statistical analysis, and modeling.
**Project Objective**
 This project delves into an anonymized advertisement dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develop a basic regression model for predicting product prices. While the dataset cannot be shared here due to restrictions, the core analytical techniques are presented.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Data Exploration and Visualization: The project uses various visualisation techniques and plots to find the patterns in the data. Other functions are also used to identify the missing values, outliers and different variations in the data.
Data Cleaning and preprocessing: The sections also involves some basic preprocessing steps which are custom specific for the dataset and are performed on the insights from the exploratory analysis.
**Regression Modeling**
Later on some of the bases regression models are trained on the data to build a model which could predict the prices for the future products.
